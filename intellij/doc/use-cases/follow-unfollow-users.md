## 1. Primary Actor and Goals
**Primary Actor**:
- **User**: Seeks to follow or unfollow other users to engage with their content or stop seeing updates from them.

**Goals**:
- Allow users to follow another user, adding the followed user to their following list.
- Allow users to unfollow previously followed users, removing them from their following list.
- Provide immediate feedback about the success or failure of follow/unfollow actions.
- Update the interface dynamically to reflect the follow/unfollow state.

## 2. Preconditions
- The user must be logged into the app.
- The user is on another user's profile or a page where the option to follow/unfollow is available (e.g., a search results page or followers list).

## 3. Postconditions
### **Successful Completion**:
1. If the user clicks **Follow**, they are added to the "follower" list of the target user, and the button/state updates to **Unfollow**.
2. If the user clicks **Unfollow**, they are removed from the "follower" list of the target user, and the button/state updates back to **Follow**.

### **Failure Scenarios**:
1. If the user attempts to follow themselves:
    - The action will not be performed, and an error message like _"You cannot follow yourself"_ is shown.

2. If thereâ€™s an issue with the server or action fails:
    - Display an error message like _"Unable to process request. Please try again."_
